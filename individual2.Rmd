```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(choco, aes(x=Rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = .1)
ggplot(choco, aes(y=Rating)) + geom_boxplot()
```

The majority of the entries have a rating between 2.5 and 4 (inclusive). I decided to also make a boxplot to determine true outliers more easily. As you can see, there are a few outliers on the low end, with only a single one on the high end.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(choco, aes(x=Rating, y=Cocoa.Pct)) + geom_point()
```

By plotting the data as a scatterplot with X=Rating and Y=Cocoa.Pct, you can see that there is no correlation between the two values.
